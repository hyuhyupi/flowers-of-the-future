<h1>Tash Keuneman On Climate Action, Zine-Making 
  And What It Means To Design For Real Life</h1>
</div>

<div class="author">
  <sub>Julien Ortiz in conversation with Tash Keuneman</sub>
</div>

  <div class="bio-1"><i>Tash Keuneman</i> is a designer of software passionate about improving human and planetary welfare.
    She's the head of design at Sonder; a company that helps organisations improve the wellbeing of their people with a comprehensive care platform, and a 
    co-founder of the climate action non-profit, the Keuneman Foundation. Currently based on Dharug and Gundungurra land in the Blue Mountains, she also creates zines and essays about creativity. </div>

<div class=interview-text-1>
 <b>You describe your practice as being in the liminal space between product, writing and climate action — and I feel like that multidisciplinary existence is very resonant with a lot of creative practitioners. How do you say being involved in these different material spaces informs the ways you want to make change in the world?
</b>
<br><br><br> 
<p>
  Well, I think I did a lot of work to figure it out. For the first, I would say, 15 years of my career, I was zigzagging a lot, doing things that I really enjoyed doing for the sake of it, which was very pleasurable. And then I found product design —  and I just fell in love with it and tried to learn about and do as much in that space for as long as possible. But then I got to a point in my career where I reached the level that I wanted to and I was like, <i>“Oh, is that it? Is that all I'm doing right now?”</i> Like, I was working at a U.S company, which was amazing, and travelling around the world pre-pandemic but I still felt a bit broken in how I was doing things, because I was trying to optimise for earning a shit ton of money and then giving away a big chunk of it — and I was kind of getting broke out in the process. 
  <br><br>
  So my partner and I — we were really early stage <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/"><u>Atlassian</u></a> employees, which was really lucky for us. So we just put a chunk of that money from that aside. A really big chunk. I was like, <i>“let's just get that to donate to climate action efforts,”</i> through the foundation. And it kind of calmed down my existential crisis a little bit, which gave me a bit of the permission to double down on all of the different flavours of things that I do, because I realise that I need variety in my life in order to feel fulfilled. And that there are different mediums for that — writing and drawing and stuff I find really pleasurable, whether that's applying that to my work or zines or essays, or my thesis on where we need to donate to climate action for each year. So, yeah, I think it's like, find the thing, the medium you like to think in and then double down in that. But also, like, continue to do weird shit in your life! You know, if one day you're like, <i>“I'm gonna make body lotion from scratch!”</i> — then go for it. Like, life is too boring, otherwise. I think a lot of people have weird thoughts but they don't really follow it. But it could be fun if you didn't think!
</p>
</div>

<div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Yeah. I feel like a lot of creatives like to dabble around a bit and it's like they're interested in all these different things, but also they want to avoid creative burnout by getting that sort of variety. I guess it really helps almost with sanity, honestly.
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  I think one of the best things that a friend told me this year was — I used to think that being tired was a really bad thing and that it equaled ill-health or something to avoid. And when she reframed being tired as showing that you've done a good day's work — I think that really helped me a bit.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>It seems to me like your zine making practice is almost liberatory for you, amongst all of your philanthropic work and such. How and why did you start creating zines?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  I got into zines because of the riot grrrl movement in the nineties. I was really into music. I wanted to be a music journalist, like a heavy metal music journalist at the start of my career. And then I was researching female heavy metal artists, which kind of got me into Bikini Kill and the riot grrrl movement of the nineties, which is around the Nirvana era. And then that's how I found out about that craft, the idea of creating really easy, affordable photocopy things that you could share with people. Even though arguably my work requires a lot of computer time, I don't enjoy being in front of a computer outside of those hours. So I kind of like that the zine is tangible. And it's a moment in time if you think about it. In product software, like software design, every time there's an iteration of your work it gets erased and then replaced with something new. Whereas I really love the idea of giving a zine out to a friend then reading it once, forgetting about it, shoving it into a drawer and then finding it later. Like, I think that's nice.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Yeah. That connection people make with the material they have in front of them — it almost links to emotions of gentleness —  which is something mentioned within your zine  “the anti manifesto.” Can you elaborate more on what it means for you to integrate that sort of compassion in your designs?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  That’s a good question. I think in the design world, what I try to get my team to do is design for real life scenarios. This isn't a concept by myself, it's really what we call design for real life. Instead of assuming that somebody has only your tab open and they've got all of the attention in the world, imagine that they're a really stressful parent and it's 3 p.m. and they're trying to get their work done so that they could pick up their kid, or they've got a broken arm, or, you know, they don't see their gender in the drop-down and then they just feel really poorly about the rest of the experience. If you put yourself in the context of a real human experiencing real emotions, I think it allows for better designs, empathy and compassion, as opposed to being very ego driven and thinking that your [design] is the only thing that they’ve got.
 </p>

  “If you put yourself in the context of a real human experiencing real emotions, I think it allows for better designs, empathy and compassion, as opposed to being very ego driven and thinking that your [design] is the only thing that they’ve got.”
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>I think that's a good thing about social design, like designing from a humanistic perspective, rather than just pumping out products to certain clients. So you already dabbled a bit into the user experience in your practice and I saw <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/finding-the-numbers-in-qualitative-research-e4f9f165c213">
    <u>your article on Medium</u></a> about how you especially center qualitative data in your process. Can you define a bit more what this means?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  It's really easy in the world that we live in right now to want to rely on quant-data rather than qual-data. But it can also be misleading and quantitative data tends to tell you what somebody does, it doesn't tell you how or why they did it. And so I think there's something to be said with speaking powerful stories in the business context around the emotion of somebody and how they want to feel when they use your product, right? I just watched this video of Jony Ive from Apple, he was the chief design officer talking about the iPhone and how he and his team made lots of decisions based on how they want somebody to feel. Because he ultimately thinks that if you care about the end product, people will be able to feel it beyond anything that 
  their conscious brain registers. And I really like that, very romantic notions, like you care.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Yeah, it's very good to be romantic and idealistic in what you make. And I feel a lot of things lack that, so that’s great. 
<br><br>
    So, amongst your many passions, climate activism is a big one of yours, evidenced by your starting of the <a href="https://www.keuneman.org/"><u>Keuneman Foundation</u></a>
    with your partner, Wendell. Can you elaborate a bit more on your mission and how you want to make an impact in the world through this foundation?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  I think when we first started out —  we both come from a product background —  he was a founder a couple of times and I've done product design for a while. So when we looked at the problem, we were like, <i>“oh, clearly, research and development 
  will be able to solve this!” [laughs]</i>  Like we just had a bit of a logical brain on like, you know, <i>“let's just fix it with technology and then the rest will sort out.”</i> And since then, what I've learnt is that most of the time the technology 
  already exists or we have enough existing technology for us to reach zero carbon emissions within the time frame that we've got. The things that are stopping us are adoptions. In particular for Australia, we have a lot of old government legislation that supports fossil fuel companies and so it's just a matter of being really quick in phasing that out and replacing it with clean energy. And so 
  that's kind of the theme that we're on at the moment. We're doing it through multiple ways. Like one is working with <a href="https://envirojustice.org.au/"> <u>Environmental Justice Australia</u></a> where they're basically taking the government to court over every time there's a new fossil fuel project.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Trying to hold them accountable.</b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
  Yeah, trying to hold them accountable to be like, <i>“this is really bad for humans,”</i> which I kind of like — it's kind of disruptive and agitating, but with the law!
 </p>
 </div>


 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>On that, I think with climate activism and getting into it, especially with a lot of climate anxiety, it can be very daunting especially for people who want to get into those spheres. They may not know where to go, or what resources to access. 
    Do you have any advice for people who are curious about learning or venturing into these spaces for the first time?</b>
 <br><br><br>
 <p>
  Yes. I think the greatest trick that was ever played on people who want to do something about climate activism is thinking that we have to police each other instead of policing corporations and the government. As in, we spend so much time arguing about, <i>“Can you be pescatarian versus vegan? Is that a single-use plastic water bottle or a reusable one?”</i> They're very important, but they're also in the long, long, long, long tail of things that we need to do. And if we take more effort to fight, 
  or rather work with companies and the government to make big shifts happen, then I think that with one change, we can make a huge difference. 
  And I also think you have to, with climate anxiety. Climate anxiety is really a result of not facing climate grief full-on, in the sense that it's really hard to sit with the fact that if we continue on our current trajectory, humanity as we know it won't exist. 
 </p>

  <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>That's a big fact to deal with. <i>[laughs]</i></b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    Yeah, it’s a really big fact. I just did a really great meditation course called <a href="https://plumvillage.org/courses/zen-and-the-art-of-saving-the-planet"><u>Zen and The Art of Saving the Planet</u></a>. And for like two weeks, the course was just like "just sit with that" — 
    and I thought that I was a realist, but then sitting with that, I was just like, there's waves and waves of grief here because I think that I'm doing enough, but it doesn't feel like it. 
    But then the course finishes with like, "well, if you're really mindful and you're in the sense of you're walking, you're breathing, you're eating and you're joyful about it, it'll actually in the long run, give you more energy to do the work for longer." Um, rather than like, 
    quitting your job, going into a not-for-profit, getting out after a year and then going back into a corporate killing relationship <i>[laughs]</i>. Like there is a way to do it a bit more sustainably and we're gonna have to have <i>sustainable joy</i> as people, because it's gonna be pretty hard.
   </p>
   </div>

   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Yeah, especially in removing that individual guilt and more so addressing the systems that perpetuate harmful 
      climate actions. That really could be the first step, just accepting that. </b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    Yeah. And we’ve benefitted from these systems, it’s not like it’s all evil rich men making these decisions. We’ve benefited from them in some small way and it's all about rewriting it.
   </p>
   </div>


   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Going onto some more lighter questions <i>[laughs].</i> Where do you find inspiration in art or life?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    Most of the time it's actually in science journals than anything else, or like space stuff because it's fucking weird and we know so little that it can be inspiring to question humanity in a sense. Like I think I really love questioning gender and societal norms. I think that we are all following invisible rules, but we're not sure why and they're ultimately antiquated. And I think our exploration of space and animal life kind of validates that. Like as an example — for the longest time in science, we had just assumed that animal female genitalia matches human genitalia because nobody did the research, nobody cared to ask. We've been so focused on what happens with the male animals that we haven't even looked at the female animals. 
    And that's like, fucking wild. So we're finding things, like I was reading an article yesterday where there's a bacteria in those little roly poly bugs. If they're infected by them, they turn female and there's enough of them now where they've almost been embedded into the genes of these roly poly bugs. Like the bacteria is basically turning most of these roly poly bugs female, which is just crazy. I just think it’s really cool.
   </p>
   </div>

   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Wow. It's good to question stuff, you can just find a whole new world of things. So would you say your community is around the Blue Mountains area, in Springwood? Do you reside here?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    We've been here for four years now, which is great. And we came from the city, in Sydney. I think being in the Mountains was a really 
    nice way to live out during the lockdown era. The community here has a really thriving zine community which is really lovely. I think the Mountains area has the highest population of artists in New South Wales, which is also really nice. I am a very fast-paced, driven person and just being in these surroundings, it's really good because when you do make friends and stuff like that, 
    they in a way cause me to reflect and slow down a bit. 
   </p>
   </div>

   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>In speaking about community, I think that’s all very important because you can be within the community, but it feels like if you don’t participate in it you don’t really understand it that much. 
      And being around that collective of people who may share similar interests in the fact that they may be artists too or see the same sorts of beauty in things you see — I think that’s very inspiring.</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    For sure. I think the thing about being in the Mountains is that everybody kind of lives their life, I would say at 80&#37 capacity, which would mean that whenever there's something coming up, they have the space for it. 
    You know, the closer you get to the city in Sydney, the more it starts to be at 110&#37 capacity. So everything's a bit more fast. Not that that's bad. I think that there's pros and cons to both country life and city life. The blend is to have it in between, to have both.
   </p>
   </div>

   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Do you think there’s something you want people to realise about the community area of the Blue Mountains? Is there a need that needs to be addressed?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    I'd say, in terms of supporting art ventures and practices and stuff, the government has done a lot of good work over the last couple of years — in terms of giving out grants, the 
    <a href="https://bluemountainsculturalcentre.com.au/"><u>Blue Mountains Cultural Centre</u></a> is also really great in terms of supporting people, 
    <a href="https://www.mocs.org.au/"><u>MOCS</u></a> as well. So I'd say it's actually: how do we get more of the practices that work here and then spread that out to other regions?
   </p>
   </div>
   

  <div class="pullquote">
    “How do we get more of the practices that work here and then spread that out to other regions?”
  </div>

  <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Are there any other particular community initiatives you feel that more people should know about?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    I think the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtnszineclub/"><u>mtns zine club</u></a> is pretty great. MOCS does a lot of really good stuff too, and the Blue Mountains 
    Cultural Centre, the work that they run all of the time is really great. There’s also this LGBTQ book club that 
    meets at <a href="https://www.goodearthbookshop.com/"><u>Good Earth Bookshop</u></a> once a month and there’s some really cool people there.
   </p>
   </div>

   <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>Last question — what do you enjoy most about your work?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    So my goal is that whatever I put my efforts into either reduces human suffering or planetary suffering. And so the easy part is that all of the big things that I do tend to try to work on those. So like my work at <a href="https://sonder.io/"><u>Sonder</u></a> where we help with supporting people, 
    you know, 24/7, around the clock — and that's something that's really meaningful to me. You know, we alluded to climate anxiety earlier, like I just think that there's gonna be spikes in the next 20 years where it's gonna be uncomfortable for a lot of people and they're gonna require support, so I think the work at Sonder is really meaningful that way. 
    The climate work is also really meaningful and then I think with the zine practice and my writing, it's kind of the more tangible thing that's like — that instant gratification <i>[laughs]</i>. I feel like, you know, because with climate action, essentially if it’s doing a good job, it's invisible.
