    One can't really think they understand a community without actually immersing themselves in one. After copious amounts of research and secondary reading, a practice of learning from afar, this detachment from participation spurred me on to change this stagnancy — like my project, I had to mobilise.
<br><br>
    Of course, putting yourself out there and meeting other people can be a challenge, but that was why I decided to add this element to my project in the first place. Asking a couple of my friends to be participants, we decided to join in a local zine making workshop called Zines as A Form of Activism and Rebellion, facilitated by Tash Keuneman  at the Blue Mountains Cultural Centre. Going to the centre was a journey in itself, though an hour is a typical time frame for my normal commute from home to uni, the hour train ride from Penrith to Katoomba via the BMT brought a new sense of novelty as we passed natural viewscapes that re-introduced us to a life outside of our passive hustle and bustle in the city.
    <br><br>
    Upon arrival at the workshop, we were tentatively greeted by other participants who had stumbled upon this same opportunity — writers, artists looking for inspiration, social workers, or the common citizen just wanting to immerse themselves in a day of zine making. Nervousness was common at the beginning, but instead of being treated as an undesirable feeling in the workshop, it was welcomed.

    Prior to this workshop, the three participants had not engaged in creative forms of activism before, but still expressed their willingness to become more politically active. To understand the new experience of this workshop for them, I surveyed these participants on how they felt about it. Findings suggest that unfamiliarity of the material or a perceived lack of skill or knowledge influenced their comfortability with the workshop atmosphere, with Participant A expressing, “I was personally excited for the workshop but also very nervous. I have never created a zine before and to be honest, didn't fully understand it was.” Participant B also expressed some concerns with their lack of activist background, “Introductions were also very nerve-wracking as I am not very involved in activism and felt that I didn't have much to contribute to the group.”

    However, participants enjoyed the social and community-making aspect of the workshop, with Participant C expressing, “It was interesting to learn about other people's zines and where their root of activism stemmed from.” Moreover, the opportunity to learn creative skills in zine-making and socio-political education was seen as inspiring to other participants, particularly in nurturing a budding interest in continued participation, “At the end of the workshop I was very satisfied with the experience and was happy to have learned more about zine making, the people there and also myself. I would be interested in going in again especially having had prior experience.”
<br><br>
    While this is not an evaluation of the emotions of participants, the emergence of these feelings point to a multi-faceted experience when put into new learning situations, allowing the space to nurture and consider newly introduced ideas and practices. Thus, activism can also be a social mode of working, allowing the opportunity for sharing and in turn, shifts in perspective. Further, participants' involvement in these workshops not only allowed for a sense of personal and ideological growth, but supported the continuation of these programs as a form of grassroots activism.

    <p>
        The zine making itself was chaotic yet exhilarating, nerve-wracking yet inspiring, scary yet empowering, as one would expect the typical creative process is. Many people weren’t able to finish their zines, but that was okay, the fact we had gathered our deepest passions and worries and translated them into something that showed what each individual stood for — that dialogue and reflection was more indispensable than any refined design outcome.
<br><br>
        Sometimes a break from the papers is needed in a research project — and I feel like it's greatly needed in mine. In talking about community, knowing about it can teach you a lot, but experiencing it can offer a whole other realm of opportunity.
