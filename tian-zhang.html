  <div class="bio-1"><i>Tian Zhang</i> is an independent curator, writer, facilitator and collaborative artist based on Dharug Country in Western Sydney. She is a co-founder and co-director of Pari, an artist-run space in Parramatta that uses collective practice to explore the intersections of the social, political and personal within their local communities. 
    In this interview, Tian shares the creative process of Pari and speaks about the value of care and collectivity within art spaces and beyond.  </div>

<div class=interview-text-1>
 <b>I've read a lot about your practice and one thing that stood out to me is how deeply committed you are to collectivity in the arts. In what ways does community and collaboration inspire the way you work?
</b>
<br><br><br> 
<p>
    I mean, I think it's the core of what I do and it's what I find the most rewarding. Part of my practice is working with other people, which results in collaborations and working in collectives. I think that we make better work when we make it with other people who we can trust and who share a similar vision and values. And it's a way I guess, to offset my strengths and where I sort of need support in other areas. Working with other people really helps to be able to make better work.
</p>
</div>

<div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>I read your 2021 interview with Runway Journal where you stated that Pari was born out of the realisation that at the time that there was no independent contemporary gallery space in Parramatta, and a lack of artist run spaces in Western Sydney. Can you tell us more about how Pari started and why it was important that you provided this space?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    Pari started initially with a group of people who similarly realised or had been thinking about having an independent gallery space, or an artist-run space in Western Sydney. We became connected to each other in various ways, some through introductions through friends; others by introductions through Parramatta Artists Studios, where a few of us were connected to. And the founding team — Rebecca Gallo, Kalanjay Dhir, Alexander Tanazefti, Justine Youssef and Sasanki Tennakoon — we met consistently for maybe about 18 months, just to talk about the space and the values of the space before we actually landed the lease. I guess we met not knowing if anything would actually eventuate. That's sort of how we started — it was just having a bunch of meetings and then working methodically through “Will we get a space? How will we pay for it?” We applied for grants, we contacted the local council and then eventually we were able to secure the space that we have now, and the funding that allows us to exist.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>To people who may not know, can you explain what artist-run initiatives are and what differentiates it from mainstream art institutions?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    So I guess, in the name of it, artist-run-initiatives are initiatives from artists. I guess at Pari we have a broader approach to who is an artist. I like to use the term for Pari that we're a "collective-run" space, because maybe not all of us fully identify as artists but we all have practices where we’re artists, we’re writers, designers or curators. So we all have creative practices. Artist-run-initiatives, or ARIs, are different to other gallery spaces or other arts organisations in that they are led by artists. They are led by people who make or write or create and there's an independence to that space and a more DIY or community based approach compared to other places. Particularly in Western Sydney, there's a lot of art centres that are connected to local government and while they've been really important in supporting artists' careers and artists' practices, I think that having an independent space that is led by artists themselves is really important.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Yeah, definitely. I like what you said about that because I didn't really think about it that way, that you would define yourself as more of a collective rather than an artist-run-initiative because not all people in it may identify as artists, but they do have those sort of creative inclinations. That’s great. So in that, what is the process of Pari in arranging your exhibitions and events? Does this come out of a particular need or ask from the community, or do these ideas just gradually emerge over time? What kind of processes and networks are involved in that?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    Yeah, so our main program is the exhibition program, because we are predominantly a gallery that is put together predominantly from an open call that we do every year. So we do a call-out asking people to submit applications and then from those applications, artists can either propose a single work that they're making, or maybe a couple of different options for us to look at. And then from those applications, we group artists who have similar works or similar themes and they become the start of the group show that you'll see in the space. Once the loose theme is decided upon, we will often invite maybe one or two other additional artists into that show to, in some way, complete that group show schematic. Depending on the make-up of that show, what that work is sort of depends, sometimes it's like, <i>“oh, we might need another sculptural work,”</i> or, you know, <i>“we're lacking this particular perspective around this topic.”</i>
<br><br>
    So that's the exhibition space and then in addition to that, we have other programs that are proposed and led by Pari co-directors. Yeah, it's a process where people sort of suggest ideas for projects. We have this Slack channel which is called “wild ideas” and that's where we might just put down those very fledgling ideas that we're thinking about, or if we've noticed that something is missing in our community or something is needed, that's where we put those ideas and they can be really small things or very big things and then that gets commented on and fleshed out by other people. Then eventually, when it comes to particular times when grants are open, then we will look back on those “wild ideas” and pick one that stands out as something that we think is necessary or urgent, or just will be really great to have, and then we'll then use that to apply for the grant. If we're successful, then we can deliver the project.

  <b>I've read your <a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/essay/a-manifesto-for-radical-care-or-how-to-be-a-human-in-the-arts/">
    <i>“<u>A manifesto for radical care or how to be a human in the arts</u>”</i></a> and in it, you state that “one of the goals of radical care is decentralising, and reducing our reliance on institutions to care for us. This means divesting from them, claiming communal agency and redirecting resources to those who need it most.” Can you explain further what you mean by this?
 </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    When I wrote that, I think I was really thinking about how sometimes we look to institutions, 
    and by institutions, you know, it might be arts organisations and galleries and museums or 
    universities. We look to these big structures to, in some ways, save us or help us. And I guess what
     I noticed is that it can often lead to disappointment. For me, when I think about the times that I 
     have felt really supported, or really cared for, they've not been in those spaces. They've been in 
     community spaces — they've been in spaces like Pari, other initiatives that I've been a part of, 
     more working groups, grassroots things, community projects. And so I guess it was a call for 
     restructuring how we imagine and think about care. That while these places have a lot of resources,
      they might not always have the best intentions, or if they do have the best intentions, they maybe 
      don't fully follow through in the ways that we'd like. In turning to them, we're also giving them 
      some sort of power over us. And so what I was trying to imagine was ways to sort of both resist 
      that, or use it to our advantage, to try and divert resources, like I said, to these other spaces 
      which are more nourishing. Yeah, and I feel like if everyone was on board and doing that, then it 
      would be a much more equal and equitable distribution.

  </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Yeah, that's great, it kinda segues into the next question. You mentioned equal and equitable distribution as one — what do you think are other benefits of working collectively?
  </b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    For myself, working collectively means that I don't have to do everything. It means that I can share the load, it means that I can have more fun, because I'm often working with people who I choose to work with. No one is forcing us to work together, we're actually coming together, based on this mutual respect, understanding, shared vision and shared values. And so we choose to work together. And so it's more joyful. And because of that as well, I feel like we are able to work together in really rewarding ways.

 </div>

 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>Other than Pari, are there any other collectives or initiatives you're excited about or you are involved in?</b>
 <br><br><br> 
 <p>
    I'm not involved in any others — one collective is enough! [laughs] I am actually curating an exhibition at Blacktown Arts that involves seven other collectives in Western Sydney. So maybe I'll just name all of them because I think they're amazing — that's why I really wanted to bring everyone together in the one project. So that involves Pari, it involves Arab Theatre Studio, Dance Makers Collective, The Finishing School, The Adorned Collective, Open Source, and We Are Studios. They're all really exciting. A lot of them have been practising and been together before Pari existed. So yeah, it's really important to highlight all of them, you know, not all of them are in the visual arts, they work across a lot of different art forms. They're all really making amazing things happen.
 </p>
 </div>


 <div class=interview-text-1>
  <b>What is one thing that you believe the Parramatta community or the Western Sydney community in general needs right now? Or what do you want people to realise about these communities?
  </b>
 <br><br><br>
 <p>
    I'm going to come back to having more equitable distribution of resources. I think that's a really great place to start. I think there's other needs, but often they are met within the community. But what happens is that they don't have as much access to resources as other places and then this causes a lot of tension and problems. And just being able to stretch that, you know, across everyone who needs it is really hard. So yeah, what I think is needed is just better distribution of resources. And I would want people to know that a lot of amazing people are making a lot of amazing work.
 </p>
 </div>

  <div class=interview-text-1>
    <b>In an ideal world, what is something that you hope for the future of creative spaces?</b>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>
    I think with the future of creative spaces — just maybe that there’s <i>more</i>. Maybe that there's more independent spaces in particular, because we all exist in an ecology. I think it's important to have peers and friends and all of us supporting each other. I don't want Pari to be the only artist-run initiative in Western Sydney, or the only independent gallery space, and there's other collectives that I just mentioned. It would be great to have more, so that we can all support each other and grow the ecology — and share the resources around.
