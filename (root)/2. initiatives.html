<p>Insults, violence and vandalism – Asian Australians and Asians living in Australia have been subjected to a huge increase in racist incidents since the advent of COVID-19.

they were targeted due to the pandemic. Diversity Arts Australia has partnered with Erin Chew, Being Asian Australia, the Asian Australian Alliance in collaboration with 
Osmond Chiu and Democracy in Colour to gather reports of Covid19-related racism. We collected over 500 stories of xenophobia and abuse, you might have heard about it on 
The Age, news.com.au, ArtsHub or the ABC. Find out more here. We’re responding with an artist-led project to confront xenophobia and racism, bust stereotypes and provide

<p>We represent over 40 arts and cultural organisations and local councils. We seek to amplify our region’s artists and cultural practitioners. We respect First Nations cultures 
and the more than 250 language groups that are spoken in Western Sydney, where our communities express the diversity that is modern Australia. We shine a light on the vibrant 
arts and cultural activities, advocate for the benefits to the community and beyond, and share the unique events and artistry that is taking place in our region. We are 
unincorporated and membership based, and open to any arts or cultural organisation based in Western Sydney.</p>
